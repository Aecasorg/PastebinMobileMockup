## Notes

The idea is that the orange plus sign/button would animate down to form the centre circle button of the bottom tool bar of subsequent views. Ideally the bar items would move slightly to let the centre button fit symetrically. Additionally the view was change behind the toolbar (sliding up and down) without changing the toolbar.
